### [Remapping Memory Regions](https://github.com/Evulpes/Remap-Memory-Region)
#### Preview:
> Like that one extra said in Game of Thrones, "it is known". It is known that you cannot set your Memory Protection Options greater than the initial level. I say this but I can't source it; I'm SURE Microsoft will have written it down somewhere, so go find it and pull request. However for now, it is just known, unless you go try it.

> This restriction creates a bit of a problem in some cases. For example, what if there's a region that only has PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, as it's initial level, but you want to write to, or modify, its memory? In most cases, you can't. You can also think of this as an oppurtunity; what if you have an application that you want to protect from memory edits?

### [The Possible Game](https://github.com/Evulpes/The-Possible-Game)
#### Preview:
> As a wise man once said, “Nothing is impossible, except this game”, and that man was almost right. However, what said man forgot was that NOP sliding your way to victory is actually indeed a valid strategy

### [Reverse Me](https://github.com/Evulpes/Reverse-Me)
#### Preview:
> Simply put, I was bored one day and asked my friend, Maximus Hackerman, to give me something to do. Promptly, he sent through a simple executable called "ReverseMe.exe" (VirusTotal Link) with a simple comment of “print the hidden message in your own application”.
