## Complete Write-Ups
### [Remapping Memory Regions](https://github.com/Evulpes/Remap-Memory-Region)
#### Preview:
> What if there's a region that only has PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, as it's initial level, but you want to write to, or modify, its memory? In most cases, you can't. You can also think of this as an oppurtunity; what if you have an application that you want to protect from memory edits?

### [The Possible Game](https://github.com/Evulpes/The-Possible-Game)
#### Preview:
> As a wise man once said, “Nothing is impossible, except this game”, and that man was almost right. However, what said man forgot was that NOP sliding your way to victory is actually indeed a valid strategy

### [Reverse Me](https://github.com/Evulpes/Reverse-Me)
#### Preview:
> Simply put, I was bored one day and asked my friend, Maximus Hackerman, to give me something to do. Promptly, he sent through a simple executable called "ReverseMe.exe" (VirusTotal Link) with a simple comment of “print the hidden message in your own application”.
